// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the operations and objectives of the KQL code, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// The query filters and expands assigned roles, which can help identify the use of valid accounts with specific roles.
// T1087 - Account Discovery:
// The query retrieves distinct combinations of roles and UPNs, which aligns with discovering accounts and their associated roles.
// T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:
// Filtering by OnPremSid and AccountUpn can help detect unusual or unauthorized use of application layer protocols for accessing resources.
// T1556 - Modify Authentication Process:
// The queryâ€™s focus on assigned roles and on-premises SIDs can help detect modifications to authentication processes or roles.
