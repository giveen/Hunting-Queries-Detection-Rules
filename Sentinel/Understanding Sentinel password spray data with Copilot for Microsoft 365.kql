// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// The KQL query is primarily focused on detecting failed sign-in attempts due to invalid credentials. This can be mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// Description: Adversaries may use valid accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Valid accounts may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources.
// Detection: Monitoring for failed authentication attempts can help identify attempts to use stolen or guessed credentials.
// T1110 - Brute Force:
// Description: Adversaries may use brute force techniques to attempt to gain access to accounts by guessing passwords.
// Detection: Monitoring for multiple failed authentication attempts can help identify brute force attempts.
// T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:
// Description: Adversaries may use application layer protocols to communicate with systems under their control.
// Detection: Monitoring for unusual or unauthorized use of application layer protocols can help identify malicious activity.
